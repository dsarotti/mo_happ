# Monty Hall Simulation App

This is a very simple **Flutter application** designed to simulate the famous **Monty Hall problem**. The app provides an interactive way to demonstrate why **switching doors** statistically leads to a higher probability of winning.

## Purpose of the App

The Monty Hall problem has been a source of debate and confusion for years. Despite its mathematical proof, many people struggle to believe the counterintuitive solution: **switching doors after a non-winning door is revealed increases your chances of winning from 1/3 to 2/3**.

I created this app to provide a hands-on experience for users to:
1. Understand the problem in an intuitive way.
2. See the statistical outcome through multiple simulations.
3. Challenge their own assumptions by testing both strategies: sticking with the initial choice or switching.

## How It Works

1. The user is presented with **three doors**, one of which hides the prize.
2. The user selects a door.
3. A non-winning door (with a goat) is revealed.
4. The user can choose to **stick with their initial choice** or **switch to the remaining door**.
5. The app tracks the outcomes over multiple attempts to show the success rate of each strategy.

## Features

- **Interactive Door Selection**: Choose one of three doors with a clear and intuitive interface.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Doors visually change to reflect user choices, revealed outcomes, and discarded doors.
- **Statistics Tracker**: Displays the number of attempts, correct guesses, and success rates to reinforce the mathematical solution.

## Why I Made This App

The Monty Hall problem is a classic example of how human intuition can sometimes fail in the face of probability. I wanted to create a tool that anyone can use to experiment with this problem and see the results for themselves. By engaging with the simulation, users can move beyond doubt and fully grasp the statistical reasoning behind switching doors.

## How to Run the App

You need Flutter in order to compile the project! 
I will upload an apk release soon.
